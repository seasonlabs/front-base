# Layout Partials

The aim of this directory is to hold files defining the relationship(s) between two or more components on a given space.

As an example, you may add here the definition of a _related news_ block in the frontpage, while the news-item teaser definition would be in ``component/_news.scss`` or ``component/_news--teaser.scss``
